# A Self Interpreting Spartan

Implement a minimal type theory and use it to build a self interpreter. Try to embed terms in JSON objects with javascript closure metatheory.

Bonuses, express Univalence compile, prove correctness, compile to typed web-assembly.

## Rwrr

We will implement Rwrr a javascript rewriting interpreter. The API is minimal.

```
match(expression, rule) 
rewrite(expression, rule)
evaluate(expression, environment)
```

It is inspired by mathematica and TRS presented in literature such as Term Rewriting Systems and Advanced Topics in Term Rewriting.

Rwrrr implements a rewriting logic and type checking ideas can be ported through this logic.

## Parser

We will use simple tools to define a basic extensible parser implemented in Rwrr.

```

Rewrite

```
replace({Expression1:{}}, {Expression1: {Expression2: {}}) == {Expression2:{}}
```
